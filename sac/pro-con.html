                -shows our upcoming events<br>
                -another way to passively get news out<br>
                -clubs can request to advertise their own media<br>
                -clubs can request to get their own message on the scrolling part <br>
                -in the "24/7" format, so it can run the whole day passively<br>
                -ads??? (might not be allowed or may not work because who would wanna buy adspace?<br>
                -its cool <br>

            <h2>cons</h2>
            <p>
                -on a 1 hour update rate (if i add new videos/images to it it'll take at most an hour to update)<br>
                -clubs need to email me everything they need (would need to do that anyways?)<br>
                -max file size is 100mb (GITHUB WONT LET ME DO MORE), will need to tell clubs to keep videos less than 100mb<br>
                -i dont know html css or javascript (do not look at my mess of code)
            </p>

            <h2>TO DO (if we proceed)</h2>
            <p>
                -MORE MOVEMENT (might be too static now? not too much movement tho)<br>
                -TEXT RESIZING (current a max text length, need something to make it smaller if too long)<br>
                -FADE ANIMATIONS (fade text, images, fade the dates to maybe show more than 3)<br>
                -optimize (MY CODE IS NOT OPTIMIZED) <br>
